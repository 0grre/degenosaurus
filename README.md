## Gm fren ! 👋🏻

We are probably living right now the golden age of the NFT. Opensea is full of everything, NFTs are coming to more and more chains everyday. And we all saw what happened with the first Solana summer. Solana summer was fun. Minting was fun.

For many of us, it has become a work, and fun has been slowly disappearing since then. Tasteless mints, common art, whitelist chase hassle…

Thankfully, many new projects are breathing the wind of change in the community, and we are one of those and bringing back fun to minting.

Let me ask you a question : would you rather work your whole life or make life changing gains in 1 mint ? 100% of winner have once played!

Hold your seat and stick with us, **WAGMI** !
